# Crossword Puzzle Generator

This repository contains code that creates questions and answers for a topic
that you supply. It uses the question-answer pairs to create a crossword puzzle.

You supply an initial prompt. The code searches a vectorized collection of
Wikipedia data and generates a list of people and places that are associated
with the topic. These are the puzzle answers.

Once it has the list of answers, the code searches the data again to create
clues.

Finally, the code passes the list of clues and answers to a puzzle generator.
The puzzle generator creates a crossword puzzle that uses as many of the answers
as it can fit into a puzzle grid.

## Get started

There are two notebooks in the `juypter-notebooks` directory.

### Setup

Use `crossword-setup.ipynb` to create a collection of data based on Wikipedia.

The notebook uses the Simple English subset of the Wikipedia data set from
Cohere.

This is where the language is configured: `import_wiki_data("simple", num_rows, skip_rows)`.

To import a different language, uncomment one of the other rows or edit the code
for the language name.

### Generate a puzzle

Use `crossword-create-puzzle.ipynb` to generate the puzzle.

The example code creates a puzzle based on the Harry Potter series. This is the
query prompt: `query="Get the name of a Harry Potter character or the name of a
place associated with Harry Potter"` To change the puzzle topic, edit the query
prompt.

## Requirements

This project uses [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) for the data set and LLM. You
need a Cohere API key to run the code in `crossword-create-puzzle.ipynb`.

## Credits

The code that generates the list of clues and answers is new.

The code that uses the list to generate a puzzle is a lightly modified version
of the [`crossword_helmig`](https://github.com/jeremy886/crossword_helmig)
project.
